This project, which is still in its infancy, is a web application for
recording sightings of macro life (sea slugs, flatworms, etc.).  Its
purpose is to study the life cycle of select species.

The target deployment lives at <https://kristaps.bsd.lv/slugcount.html>.

The application uses the [BCHS](https://learnbchs.org) stack.  It's not
currently built to be portable, although it's trivial to do so.

It requires [openradtool](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/openradtool) to build
and run.

**Feature requests will be silently closed**, so please limit issues to
actual problems, including style, language, and so on.
